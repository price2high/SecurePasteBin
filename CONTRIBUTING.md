# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution!

- Open an issue describing the improvement/bug.
- Fork → create a feature branch → PR.
- Follow PEP8 formatting. Keep functions small and testable.
- Include a short paragraph explaining security impact of any crypto changes.

## Dev tips
- Run from source using a venv.
- Prefer dependency pins in `requirements.txt`.
- Avoid adding heavy GUI libraries — Tkinter is sufficient here.
